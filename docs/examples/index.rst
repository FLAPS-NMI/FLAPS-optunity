Here you can find a variety of examples to illustrate how Optunity can be used in tandem with other machine learning software.
We have split the examples per language and library.

To contribute examples, please send us a pull request on Github_.

    README: KEEP THE EXAMPLE PAGES TIDY AND STRUCTURED

    To add examples, add them to the correct subfolder by language.
    If you plan to make several examples involving a specific package, make a subfolder for that package name,
    and add a rst file with its name that links to the subdirectory (cfr. python/sklearn.rst for an example).
    For single examples, just add a rst file in the language's subfolder.

    Try to make each example self-contained. If possible, add a minimal working example in 
    bin/examples/<language>/<library>/
    for interested readers to run. Dependencies on other libraries are ok.
